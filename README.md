This project reverse engineers the vendor-specific HID protocol of the **Attack Shark X68PRO HE** Hall Effect keyboard to extract real-time 16-bit analog key travel data, then feeds it into a virtual Xbox 360 controller via ViGEmBus. The result is **true analog stick input from WASD keys** -- not binary on/off, but smooth, pressure-sensitive movement proportional to how far you press each key.

## Features

- **True analog input** -- WASD keys drive the left stick with full 0-100% travel, not digital emulation
- **Two operating modes:**
  - **Hybrid** -- Only WASD maps to the left stick; keyboard and mouse pass through to the game normally. Ideal for games that support simultaneous gamepad + keyboard/mouse input.
  - **Full Controller** -- All keys mapped to Xbox buttons, sticks, and triggers. For games that require a single input device.
- **Dual analog sticks** (Full Controller mode) -- Left stick (WASD) and right stick (IJKL) with independent analog axes
- **Analog triggers** (Full Controller mode) -- Left and right triggers respond to key travel depth
- **All 67 keys mapped** -- Complete key-to-ID mapping for every key on the 65% layout
- **Live controller visualization** -- Real-time GUI showing stick position, trigger bars, and active buttons
- **Configurable curves** -- Deadzone, smoothing (EMA), and sensitivity curve (linear/exponential) sliders
- **Customizable bindings** -- Remap any keyboard key to any gamepad action via the settings panel
- **Persistent configuration** -- Bindings, settings, and selected mode saved to JSON, loaded automatically on startup
- **Interactive key mapper** -- Visual tool to map (or remap) every physical key to its analog ID
- **WebHID interceptor** -- JavaScript snippet for capturing the keyboard's protocol traffic in the browser
- **120 Hz update rate** -- Gamepad state refreshed at ~120 Hz for low-latency response
- **One-click launcher** -- `run.vbs` to start the app with a double-click, no terminal needed

## How It Works

The X68PRO HE uses a **Sonix Technology** microcontroller (VID `0x3151`, PID `0x5030`) with multiple HID interfaces. Interface 2 (`mi_02`) exposes a vendor-specific endpoint that can be switched into analog mode by sending a specific **HID Feature Report**:

```
Enable:  [0x1B, 0x01, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0xE3, ...zero-padded to 64 bytes]
Disable: [0x1B, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0xE4, ...zero-padded to 64 bytes]
```

Once enabled, the keyboard streams **Input Reports** (Report ID `0x05`) for every key event:

| Byte | Content |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Report ID (`0x05`) |
| 1 | Prefix (`0x1B`) |
| 2 | Analog value (low byte) |
| 3 | Analog value (high byte) |
| 4 | Key ID (unique per physical key) |

The analog value is a 16-bit unsigned integer ranging from **0** (key released) to approximately **350** (key fully depressed). This project reads these reports, normalizes the values, applies deadzone and sensitivity curves, and maps them to a virtual Xbox 360 controller created through ViGEmBus.

> The protocol was discovered through reverse engineering using HID descriptor analysis, raw USB sniffing, and a custom WebHID interceptor. Full technical documentation is available in [TECHNICAL.md](TECHNICAL.md).

## Requirements

- **OS:** Windows 10 or later (uses native Windows HID API via ctypes)
- **Python:** 3.10 or later
- **Hardware:** Attack Shark X68PRO HE keyboard (Hall Effect variant)
- **ViGEmBus driver:** Required for virtual Xbox 360 controller emulation
  - Download from [ViGEmBus releases](https://github.com/nefarius/ViGEmBus/releases)

## Installation

1. **Install ViGEmBus**

   Download and install the latest ViGEmBus driver from the [official releases page](https://github.com/nefarius/ViGEmBus/releases). A system restart may be required.

2. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/x68pro-he-gamepad.git
   cd x68pro-he-gamepad
   ```

3. **Create a virtual environment (recommended)**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Connect your X68PRO HE keyboard** via USB

## Usage

### Step 1: Map Your Keys (first time only)

Run the key mapper to associate each physical key with its internal analog key ID:

```bash
python key_mapper_gui.py
```

- Click **START MAPPING** to begin the guided mapping process.
- Press each highlighted key on the keyboard when prompted, then release it.
- Use **SKIP** to skip a key or **UNDO** to redo the previous one.
- Use **FREE MODE** to test individual keys and see their IDs in real time.
- Click **SAVE CONFIG** when finished. The mapping is saved to `key_config.json`.

A pre-configured `key_config.json` with all 67 keys already mapped is included in this repository.

### Step 2: Launch the Virtual Gamepad

Double-click **`run.vbs`** in the project folder, or run from the terminal:

```bash
python virtual_gamepad.py
```

- The GUI will connect to the keyboard's HID interfaces automatically.
- **Select a mode** from the dropdown in the top bar:
  - **hybrid** (default) -- Only WASD sends left stick data. Your keyboard and mouse continue to work normally. Use this for games that support simultaneous gamepad + keyboard/mouse input (e.g., Halo Infinite, GTA V, Battlefield).
  - **full_controller** -- All keys are mapped to Xbox buttons, sticks, and triggers. Use this for games that don't support mixed input.
- Click **ACTIVATE GAMEPAD** to enable analog mode and create the virtual Xbox 360 controller.
- The controller will appear in Windows as a standard Xbox 360 gamepad.
- Use the live visualization to verify stick and trigger response.
- Adjust settings (deadzone, smoothing, sensitivity) using the sliders on the right panel.
- Click **DEACTIVATE** to disable analog mode and remove the virtual controller.

### WebHID Interceptor (optional)

To capture the keyboard's protocol traffic in a Chromium-based browser:

1. Open the keyboard's web configuration tool in Chrome or Edge.
2. Open DevTools (F12) and go to the Console tab.
3. Paste the contents of `intercept_webhid.js` and press Enter.
4. Interact with the web driver -- all HID traffic will be logged.
5. Run `__webhid_export()` in the console to copy captured data to the clipboard.

## Configuration

### key_config.json

Generated by the key mapper. Contains the complete mapping of key labels to internal key IDs, device identification, and protocol details. You should not need to edit this manually.

### gamepad_config.json

Created automatically when you save settings from the virtual gamepad GUI. Contains:

- **bindings** -- Which keyboard key is assigned to each gamepad action
- **settings** -- Tuning parameters for the analog processing pipeline

| Setting | Range | Default | Description |
|---------|-------|---------|-------------|
| `mode` | `hybrid` / `full_controller` | `hybrid` | Operating mode (see Usage section above) |
| `deadzone` | 0.00 -- 0.50 | 0.05 | Values below this threshold are treated as zero |
| `smoothing` | 0.00 -- 0.95 | 0.30 | Exponential moving average factor (higher = smoother but more latent) |
| `sensitivity_curve` | 0.20 -- 3.00 | 1.00 | Response curve exponent (1.0 = linear, <1 = more sensitive at low travel, >1 = less sensitive at low travel) |
| `button_threshold` | 0.01 -- 0.50 | 0.15 | Normalized analog value required to register a digital button press (Full Controller only) |
| `trigger_threshold` | 0.01 -- 0.50 | 0.15 | Normalized analog value required to register a trigger press (Full Controller only) |
| `analog_max_override` | 100 -- 500 | 350 | Maximum expected raw analog value from the keyboard |

## Default Gamepad Layout

### Hybrid Mode (default)

Only the left stick is active. All other keys work as normal keyboard input.

| Gamepad Action | Default Key | Notes |
|----------------|-------------|-------|
| Left Stick Up | W | Analog |
| Left Stick Down | S | Analog |
| Left Stick Left | A | Analog |
| Left Stick Right | D | Analog |

### Full Controller Mode

All inputs mapped to the virtual Xbox controller.

| Gamepad Action | Default Key | Notes |
|----------------|-------------|-------|
| Left Stick Up | W | Analog |
| Left Stick Down | S | Analog |
| Left Stick Left | A | Analog |
| Left Stick Right | D | Analog |
| Right Stick Up | I | Analog |
| Right Stick Down | K | Analog |
| Right Stick Left | J | Analog |
| Right Stick Right | L | Analog |
| A Button | SPACE | Digital (threshold) |
| B Button | LSHIFT | Digital (threshold) |
| X Button | E | Digital (threshold) |
| Y Button | Q | Digital (threshold) |
| Left Bumper | TAB | Digital (threshold) |
| Right Bumper | R | Digital (threshold) |
| Left Trigger | LCTRL | Analog |
| Right Trigger | F | Analog |
| D-Pad Up | UP | Digital (threshold) |
| D-Pad Down | DOWN | Digital (threshold) |
| D-Pad Left | LEFT | Digital (threshold) |

| Start | ENTER | Digital (threshold) |
| Back | ESC | Digital (threshold) |
| Left Thumb Click | C | Digital (threshold) |
| Right Thumb Click | V | Digital (threshold) |

All bindings can be changed through the GUI settings panel or by editing `gamepad_config.json` directly.

## Supported Devices

| Device | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Attack Shark X68PRO HE | Confirmed working |
| Other Sonix-based HE keyboards | May work with key remapping -- use the key mapper to generate a new `key_config.json` |

If your keyboard uses the same Sonix chipset (VID `0x3151`) and exposes a similar vendor-specific HID interface, it is likely compatible. Run `key_mapper_gui.py` to map the keys for your specific model.

## Troubleshooting

**The keyboard is not detected**
- Ensure the keyboard is connected via USB (wireless mode does not expose the analog HID interface).
- Check that no other application has exclusive access to the device (close the manufacturer's software).
- Verify the VID/PID matches (`0x3151` / `0x5030`) using Device Manager or a HID enumeration tool.

**"ENABLE FAILED" when activating the gamepad**
- The config interface (`mi_02`) could not be found or opened. Try unplugging and reconnecting the keyboard.
- Run the application as Administrator if access is denied.

**"ViGEm ERROR" when activating**
- ViGEmBus is not installed or not running. Install it from the [releases page](https://github.com/nefarius/ViGEmBus/releases) and restart your computer.

**Stick input feels twitchy or too sensitive**
- Increase the **Deadzone** slider to filter out small noise near the resting position.
- Increase **Smoothing** to dampen rapid fluctuations (at the cost of slight input delay).
- Raise the **Sensitivity Curve** above 1.0 to make the lower end of key travel less responsive.

**Some keys are not registering**
- Run `key_mapper_gui.py` and verify all keys are mapped. Use **FREE MODE** to test individual keys.
- Check that the key label in your gamepad bindings matches exactly what is in `key_config.json`.

**The gamepad is not recognized by a game**
- Some games only detect controllers at startup. Launch the game after activating the virtual gamepad.
- Verify the controller appears in Windows Settings > Bluetooth & devices > Devices > Controllers.
- Use a tool like [Gamepad Tester](https://gamepad-tester.com/) in the browser to confirm the virtual controller is working.

**Game switches between keyboard and controller mode (flickering prompts)**
- The game does not support simultaneous gamepad + keyboard/mouse input. Switch to **full_controller** mode to map everything to the virtual Xbox controller, or check the [PCGamingWiki simultaneous input list](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/List_of_games_that_support_simultaneous_input) to see if your game is compatible with hybrid mode.
